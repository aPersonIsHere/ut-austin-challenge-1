# ut-austin-challenge-1
The Git Repository of Emmanuel Exiga for UT Austin Challenge 1.



# Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to explore and experiment, while also growing in practice the skills necessary to be a team player when programming in HTML and CSS. This requires knowing when to use classes or IDs in the style.css file to improve organization, fixing errors, and removing code redundancy, and making sites have increased accessibility for users by using semantic elements and including additional metadata.

# How To Use the Site
(On all browsers) Navigate with the arrows keys, scroll the sidebar with the mouse, or use the mouse wheel to view the full site. There are three hyperlinks in the header at the top right. Hyperlinks are intended to lead the browser to another page or section of the page. In this case, the hyperlinks lead to a different section beneath the cover image. You are welcome to click the hyperlinks at the top.
